<h1>In loving memorial of King Mufasa</h1>
<h2>1994⁠–⁠2014</h2>

<p>
  On Friday 11 June, beloved husband, father and King Mufasa died tragically at the young age of 20 years in a terrible accident as he tried to save his little son from an ambush suspected to have been planned by his brother Scar.

  When his son Simba was attacked in a gorge by a wild herd of Gnus, Mufasa jumped into the gorge to save him. While he could save Simba, unfortunately he did not survive the attack himself and died under the hooves of the running Gnus while his son was watching him. Police spokes-hyena Shenzi said that the investigation concluded that the accident could have been caused by King Mufasa's envious younger brother Scar who wanted the throne for his own tyrannical purposes. Scar is now in custody.

  Mufasa was born in the Pride land of Africa and lived with his parents Queen Uru and King Ahadi and his brother Scar at their family estate, the Pride Rock. In his young years he met his future wife Sarabi and immediately fell in love with her. When his father Ahadi died and he became king, he married Sarabi and soon their son Simba was born. Mufasa was the third king of the Pride Land.

<blockquote>
  “Everything you see exists together in a delicate balance. As king, you need to understand that balance and
respect all the creatures, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope (...) when we die, our bodies become the
grass, and the antelope eat the grass. And so we are all connected in the great Circle of Life.”
